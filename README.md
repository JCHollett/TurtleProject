# TurtleProject

This project is a personal project built using ComputerCraft, a popular mod for minecraft.

http://www.computercraft.info/

ComputerCraft has become influential in district schools for teaching young programmers how to learn to program, a lot like scratch.


My project takes the basic turtle functions and attempts to make them more distinct, dynamic and complex while keeping the interface the same with a few renames to shorten method calls.
